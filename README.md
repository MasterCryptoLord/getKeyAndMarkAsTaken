# getKeyAndMarkAsTaken
The primary purpose of this code is to manage a list of keys in a Google Sheet. When a user accesses the web app URL or clicks the custom menu item in the Google Sheet, the script finds the first available key with a status of 'ready' and marks it as 'taken'. Then, it returns the key to the user.
